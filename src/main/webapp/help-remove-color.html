    Ansible uses colors in its output to indicate different types of messages.

    If you have a plugin installed (like AnsiColor) you can allow these colors to come through into the Jenkins logs.
    If you do not have a plugin installed or do not wish to have colors in your logs, checking this box will remove the color codes from the logs.

    if you do not disable the colors and do not have a plugin installed, the job your output will contain ansi color characters like "[0;32m":
    PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
